Hydrological disturbances are an inherent feature of riparian ecosystems, which exert a strong and selective filter on plant communities. However, in cities, human-induced disturbances have long lasting consequences that can disrupt these fundamental ecological processes. To better understand how riparian plant communities respond to both urbanization and hydrological disturbances, we surveyed 57 riparian forests of the Montreal area along a gradient of urbanization and inundation intensity.</p><center><img src=../../img/riparian.JPG width=50%>
'</center><p>My <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jvs.12425>first chapter</a> aimed to unravel the role of natural and anthropogenic <em>filters</em>, as well as spatial processes, on community species and trait composition. We found that the effect of urbanization was principally indirect, through historical alteration of hydrological disturbances. This change in flooding regime allowed upland species to invade the formerly dynamic riparian habitat and led to a terrestrialization of riparian communities. Therefore, to limit the terrestrialization process and to maintain the functional diversity and composition of riparian forests, management strategies in urban areas should aim at restoring or preserving the natural hydrological processes.</p><p>My <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12565>second chapter</a> focused on biotic homogenization. While urbanization is generally associated with biotic homogenization (decrease in ß diversity) of communities worldwide, its effect depends on the scale of the study and the local context. Here, we showed that urbanization instead led to taxonomic and functional differentiation of riparian communities, as well as to a loss in local species richness. We hypothesized that the biotic differentiation process was twofold: urbanization 1) creates new habitats by reducing flooding intensity (which is an important homogenizing filter on species and traits), and 2) triggers species losses by reducing habitat size.</p><br><img style=float:right;width:30%;margin:1% src=../../img/parthenocissus.JPG>
### Impact of urban heat islands on liana abundance<p>During a
honor&rsquo;s research project, I studied the <a href=http://www.biopolis.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Brice_liana_distribution.pdf>impact of urbanization on liana
abundance in temperate
forests</a>.
More precisely, we investigated the local and landscape drivers of liana
abundance in 50 forests of the metropolitan Montréal area. We focused on the 6
most common lianas (i.e. woody vines) of the study area: <em>Celastrus scandens</em>,
<em>Menispermum canadense</em>, <em>Parthenocissus quinquefolia</em>, <em>Solanum dulcamara</em>,
<em>Toxicodendron radicans</em>, and <em>Vitis riparia</em>. Overall, our results show that
lianas benefit greatly from disturbances associated with urbanization at both
local and landscape scales. At the landscape scale, lianas benefited from
urbanization, mainly through warm microclimates created by urban heat islands
(UHI) as these species are not well adapted to cold climates. At the forest
scale, lianas were more abundant in disturbed forests and in edge habitats,
where their fast growth rate enables them to take advantage of high light
availability. Hence, with intensifying urbanization, lianas will likely become
more abundant in northern cities.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://mhBrice.github.io/>&copy; 2018-2021 Marie-Hélène Brice. 2021</a><div><a href=https://github.com/mhbrice target=_blank class="link-transition github link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Github link" rel=noopener aria-label="follow on Github——Opens in a new window"><svg height="32" style="enable-background:new 0 0 512 512" viewBox="0 0 512 512" width="32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M256 32C132.3 32 32 134.8 32 261.7c0 101.5 64.2 187.5 153.2 217.9 11.2 2.1 15.3-5 15.3-11.1.0-5.5-.2-19.9-.3-39.1-62.3 13.9-75.5-30.8-75.5-30.8-10.2-26.5-24.9-33.6-24.9-33.6-20.3-14.3 1.5-14 1.5-14 22.5 1.6 34.3 23.7 34.3 23.7 20 35.1 52.4 25 65.2 19.1 2-14.8 7.8-25 14.2-30.7-49.7-5.8-102-25.5-102-113.5.0-25.1 8.7-45.6 23-61.6-2.3-5.8-10-29.2 2.2-60.8.0.0 18.8-6.2 61.6 23.5 17.9-5.1 37-7.6 56.1-7.7 19 .1 38.2 2.6 56.1 7.7 42.8-29.7 61.5-23.5 61.5-23.5 12.2 31.6 4.5 55 2.2 60.8 14.3 16.1 23 36.6 23 61.6.0 88.2-52.4 107.6-102.3 113.3 8 7.1 15.2 21.1 15.2 42.5.0 30.7-.3 55.5-.3 63 0 6.1 4 13.3 15.4 11C415.9 449.1 480 363.1 480 261.7 480 134.8 379.7 32 256 32z"/></svg><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" width="8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:"/></svg></span></a></div></div></footer></body></html>
